# CENG Cookie Clicker Demo Project

A simplified cookie clicker game created for the CENG JavaScript Advanced Class. Throughout the class, students will learn the necessary skills to build their own cookie clicker game.

[Here's the final project](https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/cookie-clicker/6218888216625152) (lesson6.js) on Khan Academy.

## Usage

Each file corresponds to the code achieved at the end of each lesson.
Lesson 4 has two files (`lesson4a.js` and `lesson4b.js`) to show the state of the program before and after adding a button property to the `StoreItem` class.

While the corresponding sections of code are also labeled in each file, be sure to check out the individual files as later lessons may rewrite previous ones.
